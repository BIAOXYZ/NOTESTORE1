CSE206A: Lattices Algorithms and Applications (Spring 2014) http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/classes/sp14/cse206A-a/index.html

Revised lecture notes and pointers to research papers and other reading material will be posted here as we cover the material in class. As a reference, see pointers to previous lecture notes and other courses in the external links section below.

- Introduction: Lattices, Bases, Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization, and Lattice determinant.
- Minkowski's Theorem: The Shortest Vector Problem (SVP), Shortest Independent Vectors Problem (SIVP), and Minkowski's Theorems.
- Duality: The dual lattice and the Closest Vector Problem (CVP)
- Basic Algorithms for Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization, Hermite Normal Form computation, Nearest plane approximation algorithm, and Enumeration algorithms for exact CVP computation.
- Basis reduction and the LLL algorithm, with applications to the approximate solution of SVP and SIVP.
- Lattice Cryptography: Random lattices, their properties, and construction of basic cryptographic primitives, like one-way functions and public key encryption.
